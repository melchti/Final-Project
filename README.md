# Final-Project
● Summary: The main goal was to analyze snort logs and Wireshark packet captures to create a post incident report. This started by confirming that newly created Kibana alerts were working. Then monitoring live traffic on the wire to detect any abnormalities that aren't reflected in the alerting system. Upon finishing monitoring, three reports were created: Offensive Security Report, Defensive Security Report and a Networking Forensics Report to illustrate the result found. 

● Role: Security Engineer supporting the SOC infrastructure 

● Tools: Wireshark, Burpstuie, Malwarebytes
